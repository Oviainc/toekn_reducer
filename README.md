# üöÄ Token Reducer

## üìö Overview
The **Token Reducer** is a Python utility designed to efficiently reduce the number of words or tokens in large text files. This tool is particularly useful for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, data cleaning, and preparing datasets for machine learning models.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminates common words that don't add significant meaning (e.g., "and," "the," "is").
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their root form, consolidating variations (e.g., "running" to "run").
- **Synonym Replacement**: Replaces words with their synonyms to shorten text without losing meaning.
- **N-gram Analysis**: Analyzes the frequency of word combinations for effective reduction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with the Token Reducer, clone this repository and install the required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/token_reducer.git
cd token_reducer
pip install -r requirements.txt
üîß How to Use the Token Reducer
Basic Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the Token Reducer in your project:

python
Copy code
def token_reducer(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    # Tokenization
    tokens = text.split()

    # Apply reduction techniques
    stop_words = set(['and', 'the', 'is', 'in', 'to', 'of'])  # Define stop words
    reduced_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    reduced_text = ' '.join(reduced_tokens)

    return reduced_text

# Example usage
result = token_reducer('path/to/your/file.txt')
print(result)
Integrating into Your Project
Import the Utility: If you're integrating the Token Reducer into a larger project, you can import the utility function directly:

python
Copy code
from token_reducer import token_reducer
Preprocessing Data: Use the token_reducer function to clean and preprocess your text data before feeding it into your models or analysis pipelines.

python
Copy code
# Preprocess data
cleaned_data = token_reducer('path/to/your/input_file.txt')
Customize for Your Needs: Modify the list of stop words or add additional text processing techniques to suit the specific requirements of your project.

üéâ Benefits
Efficiency: Reduces processing time and memory usage by handling smaller text sizes.
Improved Model Performance: Enhances the quality of data fed into models by removing noise and irrelevant information.
Customization: Tailor the function to fit specific requirements or datasets.
