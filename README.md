# 🚀 Token Reducer

## 📚 Overview
The **Token Reducer** is a Python utility designed to efficiently reduce the number of words or tokens in large text files. This tool is particularly useful for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, data cleaning, and preparing datasets for machine learning models.

## ✨ Features
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminates common words that don't add significant meaning (e.g., "and," "the," "is").
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their root form, consolidating variations (e.g., "running" to "run").
- **Synonym Replacement**: Replaces words with their synonyms to shorten text without losing meaning.
- **N-gram Analysis**: Analyzes the frequency of word combinations for effective reduction.
