# 🚀 Token Reducer

## 📚 Overview
The **Token Reducer** is a Python utility designed to efficiently reduce the number of words or tokens in large text files. This tool is particularly useful for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, data cleaning, and preparing datasets for machine learning models.

## ✨ Features
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminates common words that don't add significant meaning (e.g., "and," "the," "is").
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their root form, consolidating variations (e.g., "running" to "run").

  Here's how to use the Token Reducer in your project:

python
Copy code
def token_reducer(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    # Tokenization
    tokens = text.split()

    # Apply reduction techniques
    reduced_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    reduced_text = ' '.join(reduced_tokens)

    return reduced_text

# Example usage
result = token_reducer('path/to/your/file.txt')
print(result)
🎉 Benefits
Efficiency: Reduces processing time and memory usage by handling smaller text sizes.
Improved Model Performance: Enhances the quality of data fed into models by removing noise and irrelevant information.
Customization: Tailor the function to fit specific requirements or datasets.

### Tips for Enhancing the README:
1. **Badges**: You can add badges at the top (e.g., build status, license) using Markdown links to external services.
2. **Links**: Ensure that any links are functioning correctly and lead to relevant resources.
3. **Screenshots**: If applicable, include screenshots to illustrate usage or output.
4. **Table of Contents**: For longer documents, consider adding a table of contents for easy navigation.






- **Synonym Replacement**: Replaces words with their synonyms to shorten text without losing meaning.
- **N-gram Analysis**: Analyzes the frequency of word combinations for effective reduction.
